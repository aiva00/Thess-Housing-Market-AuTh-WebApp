# Thess-Housing-Market-AuTh-WebApp
This is a webapp created with Streamlit and is part of a data science project created by a student of AuTh for students of AuTh. With this webapp a student can easily find good deals and affordable housing, as well as get informed with detailed analysis about its current state. In addition home owners can get estimates of the price of their rental properties, add new listings and evaluate their options.
